Performance
=====================================================================
Q: OpenCity runs very slowly on my machine, what can I do ?
A: OpenCity is a 3D game, that's why you probably need a 3D video
card ;) OpenCity is also known to be "fill-limited". It means that
you can have better graphic performance if you reduce the game
window's size. You can also disable the grid with the "g" key and/or
run OpenCity in fullscreen mode.


Q: When I launch OpenCity, a window shows up then disappears, what's wrong ?
A: Please check the content of the files "stderr.txt" and "stdout.txt".
They are located in the directory where OpenCity is launched. Often
it's because OpenCity couldn't find its data and configuration. You can
use the command-line options "--data-dir" and "--conf-dir" to specify
the right paths to OpenCity. Please refer to the README file for more
information concerning those command-line options.


Q: I have some compilation troubles, can someone help me ?
A: If you are not a developer who is familar with Linux/Windows
application compilation process then the answer is _NO_. We are low
on resources and we can not help all sunday gamers to achieve that.


SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, SDL_net errors:
=====================================================================
Please download and install the lastest SDL libraries from
        http://www.libsdl.org

If you compile OpenCity from sources, you will need the development
packages of those libraries. They contain the header files which
are necessary for the compilation process.

If you have those libraries intalled already somewhere on you system,
then try to indicate the correct path to those libraries to the linker.


Q: I have this error: "/usr/include/SDL/SDL_net.h:416: error: extra ';'"
A: It's a known issue with SDL_net.h 1.2.5. Remove that extra ';' or
download and install the latest SDL_net development library.
